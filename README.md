# HD_TechnicalTest

## Overall description
I would like to be able to search on a social network (Twitter, Facebook - up to you - Twitter is the easiest API wise) for a search term. 
Get results back in the browser.
Spend around 4-5 hours in total. The code will be presented for Heyday - no need to deploy it anywhere - local version is fine.

## Task #1
Using C# - be able to search either Facebook, Twitter API for a search term.
Results get stored in memory.

## Task #2
Data fetched from the search is presented in a presentable way in the browser (up to you how).
The solution has to involve Javascript - React JS is preferred.

## Task #3
Create an option around the search input that “only results with images” is desired. 
Display results that include an image to the user.
